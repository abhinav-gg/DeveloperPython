# Connect Four
### By Abhinav

## Tasks

### 1) line 21
> Change the hardcoded value to the variable assigned at the top of the file so the game knows how long a chain needs to be (Hint: connect seven is not very fun!)
### 2) line 28
> Change the values in the players list to be the **first letter** of the color to make the board look nicer!
### 3) line 37
> Change the boundaries in the if statement so the user can only enter columns between 1 and 7
### 4) line 54
> Don't let the users play in a full column (Hint: use the continue keyword)
### 5) line 78
> Print the board and the winner of the game (Hint: the winner is stored in the variable player)
### 6) line 85
> Let the user know the board is full (Hint: in connect four a full board with no wins means the game is a Draw!)
### Extension:
> Change the board size to whatever you want... maybe store the size in a variable.
