ASCII art is truly the purest form of art! However, someone messed up when coding it (Plot twist: it was me.) Please fix it so I don't get in trouble.

Challenge 1: Fix the square so it isn't a rectangle.
Challenge 2: Fix the orientation of the rectangle.
Challenge 3: Let the player quit by entering 5.
Challenge 4: Warn the player if they enter an invalid option.

EXTENSIONS:

1) If the user enters an invalid choice, the program should let try again until it works.

2) Make the circle printing work, because right now it just prints a rectangle (Hint: You can use the distance function to check if a point should be printed as part of the circle)
